Hi!  I'm Thom Blake.

You may be here because you're looking for a programmer to hire.  My [resume](/resume) is around here somewhere.  I do full-stack web development, but I can also do UX design, and I'm interested in machine learning and game programming.

Or you may be trying to [contact me](/contact) for some other reason. I'm known for my expertise in computer ethics and rationality.
